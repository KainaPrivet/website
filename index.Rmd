- My field of research deal with long lived plant species from temperate and Sub-Antarctic ecosystems. 
- I'm interested in plant physiology in relation with the environment at phenotypic and molecular level but also in mircobial community in interaction with the plant. 
- I would like to better understand the threat of climate change on plants living in hasrh environment or at cold margins.
