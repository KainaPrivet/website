- My research focuses on long lived plant species from temperate and Sub-Antarctic ecosystems. 
- I'm interested in plant physiology in relation to the environment at both the phenotypic and the molecular levels, as well as microbial community in interaction with the plant. 
- I would like to have better understanding of the threats of climate change on plants living in harsh environments.
