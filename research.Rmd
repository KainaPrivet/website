## my PhD 
My research interest focus on adaptive potential of long-living species to abiotic stress. In the context of climate change, I am interested in how a sub-Antarctic endemic species (_Lyallia kerguelensis_) can adapt with metabolite, rhizospherical community, morphology and gene expression changes in various natural environmental conditions. In particular I use measurement of plant dieback to determine potential adaptation of this cushion plant.
