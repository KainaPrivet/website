## Master thesis 
8 months, funded by Erasmus+ program 

Supervisors: Pr. Matteo Campioli and Dr. Jozica Gricar 

Centre of Excellence Plants and Ecosystems [(PLECO)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/pleco/), Antwerp, Belgium and at the [Slovenian foresty institut](https://www.gozdis.si/en/), Ljubljana, Slovenia

My master thesis was part of the ERC project [LEAF-FALL](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/pleco/research/research-projects/erc-grants/erc-grant-leaf-fall/). I studied the inter-individual variability in spring phenology of temperate deciduous trees in relation to tree characteristics and previous year autumn phenology. More details about my thesis are published in two papers: [Marchand et al 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108031)  and [Marchand et al 2021b](https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpaa171)

---------------

I studied the dynamics of carbon storage in poplars with drought x fertilization interactions.

I participated to a greenhouse experiment in which I took morphological measurments and harvested. In the laboratory I analysed by spectrometry the starch and the soluble carbohydrate storage of the samples.
