My master thesis of 8 month was part of the ERC project [LEAF-FALL](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/pleco/research/research-projects/erc-grants/erc-grant-leaf-fall/), and was granted by the Erasmus+ program. 

I sutdied the inter-individual variability in spring phenology of temperate deciduous trees in relation to tree characteristics and previous year autumn phenology. 

My research was at Centre of Excellence Plants and Ecosystems [(PLECO)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/pleco/), Antwerp, Belgium and at the [Slovenian foresty institut](https://www.gozdis.si/en/), Ljubljana, Slovenia
