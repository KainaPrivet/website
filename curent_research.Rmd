PhD of 3 years and 3 months from October 2018 to December 2021

Funded by the University of Rennes 1, EGAAL Docoral school

PhD director: Dr F. Hennion (CNRS) and co-supervisor Dr M. Tarayre (University of Rennes 1)

---------------- 

- During my PhD, I'm trying to determine the adaptive potential of Kerguelenâ€™s endemic species Lyallia kerguelensis to climate change. We hypothesis that a combination of genetic adaptation and individual plasticity might occur in contrasted environments with the contribution of micro-organisms. 

- I use various methodologies to capture the variability from the molecular scale (gene expression, metabolites) to the individual scale (morphology) _in natura_ in contrasted environments. I'm also interested in the relation between plants and micro-organisms and how it could help the plant under abiotic stresses.

My field work took place in [Kerguelen Islands](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Port-aux-Fran%C3%A7ais,+Terres+australes+et+antarctiques+fran%C3%A7aises/@-49.2597094,68.8780981,8z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0xb36b481cc856903d:0x1c19f1226b6d4295!2sKerguelen+Islands!3b1!8m2!3d-49.1602433!4d69.5816287!3m4!1s0xb314be5696479131:0x947bf414d8802b38!8m2!3d-49.3501774!4d70.2191162) (sub-Antarctic) during 4 months to find plant populations in various environments and collect envrionmental data and biological samples of the plant holobionte 

Back to the laboratory, in Rennes, I'm analysing with "omic" methods: metabolomic and transcriptomic for the leave and metagenomic for the microbial community of the rhizosphere.
