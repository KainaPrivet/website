My PhD aim to caracterise the adaptive potential of the endemic plant species of Kerguelens Islands in the context of climate change. 
I use various methodology to capture the variability at molecular scale (gene expression, metabolites) until individual scale (morphology) _in natura_ in contrasted environments. I'm also interesting in the relation between plants and micro-organism and how it could helpt the plant under abiotic stresses.
